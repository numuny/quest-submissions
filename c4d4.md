Take our NFT contract so far and add comments to every single resource or function explaining what it's doing in your own words. Something like this:

pub contract CryptoPoops {
  pub var totalSupply: UInt64

  // This is an NFT resource that contains a name,
  // favouriteFood, and luckyNumber
  
  pub resource NFT {
    pub let id: UInt64

    pub let name: String
    pub let favouriteFood: String
    pub let luckyNumber: Int

    init(_name: String, _favouriteFood: String, _luckyNumber: Int) {
      self.id = self.uuid

      self.name = _name
      self.favouriteFood = _favouriteFood
      self.luckyNumber = _luckyNumber
    }
  }

  // This is a resource interface that allows us to let others do and view certain items
  
  pub resource interface CollectionPublic {
  
  // this is a function called deposit with the @NFT as an input
  
    pub fun deposit(token: @NFT)
    
  // this is a function called getIDs with UInt64 as an input 
  
    pub fun getIDs(): [UInt64]
    
  // this is a function called borrowNFT with UInt64 as an input 
  
    pub fun borrowNFT(id: UInt64): &NFT
  }

  // this is a resource called Collection that has a UIn64 type and several functions

  pub resource Collection: CollectionPublic {
  
    pub var ownedNFTs: @{UInt64: NFT}
 
 // this is a function called deposit with @NFT as an input 
  
    pub fun deposit(token: @NFT) {
      self.ownedNFTs[token.id] <-! token
    }
  
// this is a function called withdraw with UInt64 as an input 

    pub fun withdraw(withdrawID: UInt64): @NFT {
      let nft <- self.ownedNFTs.remove(key: withdrawID) 
              ?? panic("This NFT does not exist in this Collection.")
      return <- nft
    }
    
// this is a function called getIDs with UInt64 as an input 

    pub fun getIDs(): [UInt64] {
      return self.ownedNFTs.keys
    }

// this is a function called borrowNFT with UInt64 as an input 

    pub fun borrowNFT(id: UInt64): &NFT {
      return &self.ownedNFTs[id] as &NFT
    }

    init() {
      self.ownedNFTs <- {}
    }

    destroy() {
      destroy self.ownedNFTs
    }
  }

// this is a function called createEmptyCollection with @Colllection as an input 

  pub fun createEmptyCollection(): @Collection {
    return <- create Collection()
  }

 // This is an Minter resource that contains the functions createNFT and createMinter
 
  pub resource Minter {

// this is a function called createNFT with string and integer type inputs 

    pub fun createNFT(name: String, favouriteFood: String, luckyNumber: Int): @NFT {
      return <- create NFT(_name: name, _favouriteFood: favouriteFood, _luckyNumber: luckyNumber)
    }
    
// this is a function called createMinter with @Minter as an input 

    pub fun createMinter(): @Minter {
      return <- create Minter()
    }

  }

  init() {
    self.totalSupply = 0
    self.account.save(<- create Minter(), to: /storage/Minter)
  }
}
