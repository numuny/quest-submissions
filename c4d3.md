Why did we add a Collection to this contract? List the two main reasons.

(1) because it is super annoying and inefficient to have to specify a different storage path for a resource type we want to add to our account and to have to remember 
each individual path a certain one was given

(2) to give others the ability to send us resource types



What do you have to do if you have resources "nested" inside of another resource? ("Nested resources")

any nested resources must be destroyed 


Brainstorm some extra things we may want to add to this contract. Think about what might be problematic with this contract and how we could fix it.

Idea #1: Do we really want everyone to be able to mint an NFT? ðŸ¤”.

not necessarily, more like we want certain people to be able to mint certain tokens, and it seem the solution would have to do with resource interfaces and collections


Idea #2: If we want to read information about our NFTs inside our Collection, right now we have to take it out of the Collection to do so. Is this good?

no it is probably not good, because we really do not want the information to be moved, we just want it to be read, that is why references would come in handy here


Idea #3: we may want to add sub-categories of collections or collections within collections?

i imagine we would use soome nestled collection code


Idea #4: we may want to limit how many someone could mint

some code to recognize the address that is doing the minting :)
